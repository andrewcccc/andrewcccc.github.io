My name is Andrew Chao. I completed my Electrical Engineering (Co-op) bachelor's degree at the University of Alberta.

I am currently a master's student at the [VUA](https://voice.lab.mcgill.ca) lab at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. I am supervised by Prof. Nicole Li-Jessen. My master's thesis is: A Usability Study of a Mobile Application for Monitoring Upper Airway Health

I am interested in mobile app development and machine learning.
