# COMP551 Applied Machine Learning Projects 
McGill University (September 2022 - December 2022)

Project 1:


The project report can be found [here](https://andrewcccc.github.io/assignment1_group_47.pdf)


Project 2: Classification of Textual Data

The goal of this project was to build logistic regression and multiclass regression models and compare them to a KNN model on two textual datasets (IMDb and 20 Newsgroup).
* Implemented LASSO feature selection functions
* Evaluate the logistic regression and multiclass regression models KNN models

Project 3: Classification of Image Data

The goal of this project was to build a multilayer perceptron (MLP) and CNN model to classify image data.
* Implemented CNN using Keras library 
* Contributed to the hyper-parameters fine tuning of L2 regularization
* Investigated the effects of test accuracy using different network depth, width, and activation functions
