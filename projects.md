## COMP551 Applied Machine Learning Projects 
McGill University (September 2022 - December 2022)

Project 1: Getting Started with Machine Learning 

The goal of this project is to build K Nearest Neighbour(KNN) and Decision Tree (DT) models on two health datasets and comapre the model performance. The project report can be found [here](https://andrewcccc.github.io/assignment1_group_47.pdf).

* Implemented KNN feature selection function based on linear coefficient
* Contributed the model evulation, such as AUROC, of the two models


Project 2: Classification of Textual Data

The goal of this project was to build logistic regression and multiclass regression models and compare them to a KNN model on two textual datasets (IMDb and 20 Newsgroup). The project report can be found [here](https://andrewcccc.github.io/assignment2_group_47.pdf).
* Implemented LASSO feature selection functions
* Evaluated the logistic regression and multiclass regression models w.r.t KNN models 


Project 3: Classification of Image Data

The goal of this project was to build a multilayer perceptron (MLP) and CNN model to classify image data. The project report can be found [here](https://andrewcccc.github.io/assignment3_group_47.pdf).

* Implemented CNN using Keras library 
* Contributed to the hyper-parameters fine tuning of L2 regularization
* Investigated the effects of test accuracy using different network depth, width, and activation functions 


## ECE Capstone Project 
University of Alberta (September 2020 - May 2021)

Objective: The goal of this project is to address this need with the development of an integrated mini production facility equipped with sensors, controllers and actuators that features both a monitoring-reporting system and an artificial intelligence based control-decision-making system to optimize conditions for plant growth and the overall energy cost.

I designed and developed an Android mobile application to retrieve our sensor data and mushroom images for monitoring the conditions of our mushrooms in the greenhouse. The project code for the app can be found in [here](https://github.com/andrewcccc/Greenhouse).

The app was built in Andorid Studio programming in Java.

Hightlights: 
* Used Retrofit API to retrieve JSON sensor data
* Used MPAndroidChart librsry to display graphical data
* Used Picasso library to retrieve image results

## Apple's Facial Movement Tracking (Co-op) Project 
University of Alberta (January 2020 - August 2020)

Problems: Some commercial tracking systems, such as Optotrak, are used in clinical research to capture facial motion. These tracking systems have limited availability because they cannot provide remote tracking applications, such as speech therapy and linguistic data gathering.

Objective: develop a novel mobile application to provide a full-face tracking system during speech production.

Tools: Xcode and an iOS device with TrueDepth camera.
