# COMP551 Applied Machine Learning Projects 
McGill University (September 2022 - December 2022)

Project 1: Getting Started with Machine Learning 

The goal of this project is to build K Nearest Neighbour(KNN) and Decision Tree (DT) models on two health datasets and comapre the model performance. The project report can be found [here](https://andrewcccc.github.io/assignment1_group_47.pdf)

* Implemented KNN feature selection function based on linear coefficient
* Contributed the model evulation, such as AUROC, of the two models


Project 2: Classification of Textual Data

The goal of this project was to build logistic regression and multiclass regression models and compare them to a KNN model on two textual datasets (IMDb and 20 Newsgroup). The project report can be found [here](https://andrewcccc.github.io/assignment2_group_47.pdf)
* Implemented LASSO feature selection functions
* Evaluated the logistic regression and multiclass regression models KNN models 


Project 3: Classification of Image Data

The goal of this project was to build a multilayer perceptron (MLP) and CNN model to classify image data. The project report can be found [here](https://andrewcccc.github.io/assignment3_group_47.pdf)

* Implemented CNN using Keras library 
* Contributed to the hyper-parameters fine tuning of L2 regularization
* Investigated the effects of test accuracy using different network depth, width, and activation functions 


# ECE Capstone Project 
University of Alberta (September 2020 - May 2021)

The capstone project was about the development of a mini smart greenhouse. The goal was to optimize plant growth conditions and energy consumption using humidity, temperature and current sensors, a camera module, and a smartphone. The project can be found in [here](https://github.com/andrewcccc/Greenhouse)

I designed and developed an Android mobile application to retrieve our sensor data and mushroom images for monitoring the conditions of our mushrooms in the greenhouse.

The app was built in Andorid Studio programming in Java.

Hightlights: 
* Used Retrofit API to retrieve JSON sensor data
* Used MPAndroidChart librsry to retrieve graphical data
* Used Picasso library to retrieve image results
