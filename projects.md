# COMP551 Applied Machine Learning Projects 
McGill University (September 2022 - December 2022)

Project 1: Getting Started with Machine Learning 

The goal of this project is to build K Nearest Neighbour(KNN) and Decision Tree (DT) models on two health datasets and comapre the model performance. The project report can be found [here](https://andrewcccc.github.io/assignment1_group_47.pdf)

* Implemented KNN feature selection function based on linear coefficient
* Contributed the model evulation, such as AUROC, of the two models


Project 2: Classification of Textual Data

The goal of this project was to build logistic regression and multiclass regression models and compare them to a KNN model on two textual datasets (IMDb and 20 Newsgroup). The project report can be found [here](https://andrewcccc.github.io/assignment2_group_47.pdf)
* Implemented LASSO feature selection functions
* Evaluated the logistic regression and multiclass regression models KNN models 


Project 3: Classification of Image Data

The goal of this project was to build a multilayer perceptron (MLP) and CNN model to classify image data. The project report can be found [here](https://andrewcccc.github.io/assignment3_group_47.pdf)

* Implemented CNN using Keras library 
* Contributed to the hyper-parameters fine tuning of L2 regularization
* Investigated the effects of test accuracy using different network depth, width, and activation functions
